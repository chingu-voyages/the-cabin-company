Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should but as much care into it's creation and maintenance steps
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article
written by another Chingu be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you've decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
